# Conclusion

Our finished solution met most of our design criteria. We were able to build a vehicle with custom components that was able to follow a lane line on a track with multiple turns with a moderate movement speed. We also were able to detect and generate bounding boxes for obstacles based on our depth images. Our traction controller was able to prevent slip from occuring on low friction surfaces. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to fully test and integrate the obstacle detection algorithm with the controller.
