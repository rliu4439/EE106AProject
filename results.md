# Results

Our vehicle is able to successfully follow a red lane line and perform close to 90 degree turns at a moderate speed. It is also able to detect obstacles in its path and determine the location of each obstacle. On low friction surfaces, the traction controller prevents the vehicle from slipping, allowing the car to continue at a higher speed on slippery surfaces.
