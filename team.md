- **Bio**: I'm a 4th year EECS major interested in machine learning and image processing. 

- **Contributions**: My main task involved creating the object detection system for the car. This involved collecting data, installing the appropriate libraries on the vehicle and designing the algorithm. I used OpenCV to detect objects in the images and used the RealSense API to calculate the real-world position of an object which was also needed for line following. This function would output the coordinate of objects so the controller could avoid them. I also worked on adjustments to the RealSense camera's configuration to improve the depth data output. I helped with the testing and debugging of the controls algorithms used for line following.
