## Introduction

## Goals
1. Build an autonomous Traxxas RC car capable of navigating a track at high speed by using computer vision to detect lane markers and obstacles
2. Implementing an MPC controller and control barrier function (CBF) to follow the track and avoid obstacles
3. Implementing a traction control algorithm to maximize vehicle traction and acceleration

## Project Description

## Real World Applications
There are various real world applications for our project. The traction control algorithm would provide additional stability and safety in wet weather conditions and would also be useful in racing. The line following algorithm is a simplified version of lane detection and  lane following, which are found in autonomous vehicles and lane keep driver assist systems. The combination of of hardware and software would provide the basic hardware and software needed for an autonomous vehicle to drive on a road with obstacles.
